# 2024-06-t2trg: T2TRG 2024-06 Interim Meeting

This meeting picks up several items that did not fit into the
2024-05-security interim.
The focus is on the use of information, data, and interaction model,
both in general and specifically in the YANG/CBOR and CoRECONF
ecosystem; both always with security considerations in the forefront.

## Logistics

This interim will happen online via meetecho, please see<br> <https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/interim-2024-t2trg-02/session/t2trg>.

Local time in various locations:<br>

join; an [IETF datatracker account](https://datatracker.ietf.org/) is
